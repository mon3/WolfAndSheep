## How to start play
You need:
* stack
* terminal
* create resources dir in main dir

In terminal go to project main dir and enter following command:
```
   > mkdir resources
   > stack build
   > stack exec .stack-work/dist/x86_64-linux/Cabal-2.0.1.0/build/game/game
```

`stack build; and stack exec .stack-work/dist/x86_64-linux/Cabal-2.0.1.0/build/game/game`
